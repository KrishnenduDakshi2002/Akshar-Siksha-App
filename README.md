# Akshar-Education for all

We are providing an innovative and effective way to educate the underpriviledged students of our society during and after covid-19.
Our Constitution provides the right to free and compulsory education for children.Unfortunately, most of the young souls are overburdened with the heavy responsibility of earning money for their families and are forced into child labour.And , in thesse dire situation of covid pandemic with schools closed, most of them are forced to quit studies altogether and earn a livelihood. Should they be deprived of their moral right only because they are poor? They have the right to education as much as the priviledeged lot has. So we at Akshar have decided to give them what they deserve, their right to get educated and secure a better future for themselves as well as their families.
